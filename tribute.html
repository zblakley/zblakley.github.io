Few actors accumulate the <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/tim_thomerson/"> body of work</a> generated by Tim Thomerson. A quintessential working actor, trained under the prestigous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stella_Adler_Studio_of_Acting">Stella Adler</a> at her New York conservatory, his work spans stand-up, television, movies, and commercials, working across from the biggest film-stars and the talentless, in some cases on the cutting room floor:<br>

          <br> 
He always brings his unique style. In 1985, Thomerson starred as the time-traveling future cop Jack Deth in the low budget science fiction film Trancers which was produced by Charles Band and Empire Pictures. The role made him an icon of the B-movie genre.
          <br>
          <br>
          "I usually try to do something more that the audience is kind of in on, if you know what I mean. Because often these are low budget or even no budget movies and it helps to bring them in on the joke and let them know weâ€™re all having a good time."
          <br>
          <br>
         
His roles span a wide range of characters and genres, from stand-up routines to cowboys to Vietnam soldiers to cyborgs to dollmen.

When Charles Band started up Full Moon Features in the late 1980s, one of his first projects was Trancers II (released in 1991), in which he reunited Thomerson with much of the cast from the first film. Thomerson would appear in every sequel thereafter, with the exception of Trancers 6, which instead starred Zette Sullivan. It is one of the great tragedies of modern cinema. 


Another movie role that made Thomerson popular with fans of science-fiction was that of Brick Bardo in the 1991 film Dollman, 
          <img src="https://www.nerdly.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Dollman.jpg">
a Dirty Harry-like alien cop who is 13 inches tall, and uses his blaster gun to take on gangsters and devil-possessed toys in two obscure feature films. The character also appeared very briefly in Bad Channels.


Enjoy a Baby Ruth with Tim:
